# 25/02/2020 v1.0.0
  added ROBOTO font
  added unsaved work marker thing
  ctrl+s to save
  ctrl+shift+s to save as
  non character keys(ctrl,alt,ect.) do not make projectnotsaved
  spell check turned off

# 26/02/2020 v1.0.1
  html should be in seperate (iframe)
  save and save as shortcut everywhere
  ctrl + e (ctrl + n can't prevent default) for new project
  auto-pairing of brackets doesn't happen if next char is number or alpha
  auto update turns off if there is script in project
  moved functions into 2 files
  changed update to run because of js support that arrived with iframe (I have left functions for finding scripts in there anyway)
  stopped autorun from happening when there is script
  made second part of bracket pair delete when first is deleted
  reformatted load button and dropdown
  set roboto to only the title so that it doesn't affect the result
  changed font in input
  fixed thing where name would say that it was unsaved when it was saved - the updateName call was after the projectIsSaved was set to true
  stopped inputbox from expanding

  --Later
  changed title
  added hover title shortcut keys to buttons
  added shortcut for delete
  check to see if project exists before making new project
  when delete current project goes to prev project instead of unnamed (or if none then unnamed)
  check to see if there are any projects before bring up confirm box
  added punctuation to some messages
  changed starting text
  ctrl + i = insanity (sorry i had to)

# 27/02/2020 v1.0.2
  added icon thing

# 28/02/2020 v1.0.3
  fixed delete confirm text
  made favicon work (Also, what is our favicon a picture of? Please tell)
  indent can be 2 or 4 spaces using dropdown
  made allInOne.html so that you can paste it into itself
  now indents to previous line indent
  added smartLog() - makes it obvious what is being logged, especially if it contains lots of spaces
  attempted to make it increase indent on <script>, function() { etc - failed because end tag gets indented annoyingly and also indents stuff AFTER end tags (such as </script>)
  added ctrl + [ decrease indent EXTREMELY BUGGY

# 2/03/2020 v1.0.4
  fixed decrease indent
  ctrl + ] increase indent

  (plans)
  increase indent on <element> and function idk() {
  add better start menu
  possibly bind load to enter if the dropdown has focus
  
  (far future plans)
  syntax hylighting (probably need to seperate all the text into different tokens :)
  intelligisense (probably impossible)
